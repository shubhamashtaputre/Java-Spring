1] You can add custom codes during bean initialization
-> calling custom business logic methods
-> setting up handles to resources(db, sockets, file etc)

2] You can add custom code during bean destruction
-> calling custom business logic methods 
-> cleaning up handles to resources(db, sockets, file etc)

3] Development process:
-> define your methods for init and destroy
-> Add annotations: @PostConstruct and @PreDestroy

4] Init: method configuration
-> Code will execute after constructor and after injection of dependencies

5] Destroy method configuration 
-> Code will execute before bean is destroyed
