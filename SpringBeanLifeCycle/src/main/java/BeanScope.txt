-> scope refers to lifecycle of bean
-> how long does bean live?
-> how many instance(objects) are created
-> how is bean shared?

by default bean lifecycle is 'singleton', here if we create two object to same bean
then second bean will refer to first object i.e., no separate object is created.

if scope is declared as 'prototype' then two different objects are created of same bean are created 
if the same bean is declared twice.

'@Scope("singleton") or @Scope("prototype")' is used to declare scope of an bean
